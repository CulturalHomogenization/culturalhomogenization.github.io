            <h2>Digitalization</h2>
            <p>Western and American value systems, ideologies and American culture as a whole are spreading worldwide via the expanding digital world brought by digitalisation, through things such as hyperconnectivity. However, digitalisation progresses, how will it affect cultures around the world and cultural homogenisation as a whole?</p>

            <h2>Eurocentrism</h2>
            <p>Eurocentrism is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as  "seen from the point of view of Europe or European people; considering Europe or Europeans to be the most important."  This demonstrates how dominant the West is, with a good example being how most studies are done in English regardless of where they are conducted. What does this mean for cultural homogenisation?</p>

            <h2>Tourism</h2>
            <p>Transcontinental tourism has very recently been introduced into societies with cultures imprinting themself worldwide.  This is a major aspect of homogenisation with a good example being how Western ideology permeates worldwide, but, what does this mean for Tradition, Culture, and Identity?</p>

            <p>With the overwhelming majority of the digital and electronic industry based in America, specifically places such as Silicon Valley, it thus only makes sense that American culture is highly dominant in the digital world.<span class="footnote">1</span></p>
            <p>It then brings no surprise that American ways of thinking, ideologies, Value systems or even symbols are being spread worldwide through the digital world. This leaves a very one-way cultural exchange for non-western countries in the digital world for how dominated by America it is. </p>
            <p>As an example, in a TF1 documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafOkWXjqjc">a tribe in Africa was asked if they knew of Michael Jackson</a>, and the majority of them knew of him. Another example would be coca-cola which is also known worldwide. </p>
            <p>However, despite the fact that the people of Africa know of American Mega corporations and superstars, most Americans will know very little of Africa. In a paper by Brenda Randolph and Elizabeth DeMulder Young it was discovered that American children are even unsure of what jobs African people have, where the young students 'seemed stumped' when asked.<span class="footnote">2</span></p>
            <p>This is a clear example of how American culture and symbols that can be associated with it are spreading worldwide but only in one direction. Even though this does explain somewhat of how American culture is spreading there is still something very important question still unanswered, why are mega corporations associated with America?
            </p>
            <p>For giant American-based mega-corporations such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Disney, and others, it can also be said they have large control over the information we receive digitally. From this, it can be said that they thus hold a massive influence on the digital area as well as even people non-digitally.</p>
            <p>This can be proven as digital companies such as Google are the major sources of information through digital media for many people, with other methods becoming ever rarer. This can be seen with the fact that there has been a 52% decrease in Newspaper revenue from 2002 to 2020 as digital media flourished.<span class="footnote">3</span> Furthermore, if observed with greater detail, it is found that from 2002 to 2010 there was a 22.8% decrease in Newspaper revenue and a 33.6% decrease in Newspaper revenue from 2010 to 2020.<span class="footnote">4</span> This shows an exponential decrease in revenue via newspapers.</p>
            <p>These statistics are not alone with many traditional non-digital media outlets suffering similarly. Conversely, digital media's annual revenue was valued at 255.99 Billion USD in 2017 and more than doubled since 2022 reaching a market value of 546.76 Billion USD. Coupled with this an article from Pew Research Center found 86% of Americans receive news from a digital device.</p>

              <figcaption>Fig 1 - Statistical Report from DataRePortal</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As shown above in Figure 1 from an article from DataRePortal, for the majority of people (59.2%) the primary reason to use the internet is to find information. This all highlights that digital media has become the dominant method of media by absorbing more traditional media and is depended upon as a source of information for many.</p>
            <figure>
              <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17109/us-digital-advertising-market-share/" title="Infographic: Amazon Challenges Ad Duopoly | Statista"><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/17109.jpeg" alt="Infographic: Amazon Challenges Ad Duopoly | Statista"></a>
              <figcaption>Figure 2 - Infographic: Amazon Challenges Ad Duopoly | Statista</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>With such a large market that affects people worldwide by being a source of common information, it is very concerning that the large majority of the advertising is held by a select few international American-based companies (as seen in Figure 2). This means America can and is heavily influencing digital media through its sheer dominance of the market.</p>
            <figure>
              <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/4943/top-10-media-companies/" title="Infographic: The World's Largest Media Companies | Statista"><img src="https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/4943.jpeg" alt="Infographic: The World's Largest Media Companies | Statista" width="100%" height="auto" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a>
              <figcaption>Fig 3 - Infographic: The World's Largest Media Companies | Statista</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This dominance can also be seen in Figure 3 where the majority of the world's top media companies are American. Coupled with this much of the electronic and digital industry is based in America as said previously. This means that American mega-corporations are very dominant in most media outlets and thus people's sources of information as well as advertising, meaning that American influence comes through American mega-corporations very often. This explains why the names of American mega-corporations are so well-known seeing as they dominate as the most common source of information for people and can lead towards cultural homogenisation because of how this can slowly spread American values and culture to other countries at such a level that its influence can be felt worldwide.</p>
            <p>An example of this is how Hollywood and Disney are slowly spreading American culture into other countries. This can be seen with how most movie scripts follow standard Western troupes and have slowly popularised these troupes.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Digitalisation is spreading American culture worldwide through the help of media and the digital area by American-based mega-corporations. This is resulting in a homogenisation of culture as it is a one-way cultural exchange between America and the world.</p>

            <p>Eurocentrism is a pressing problem in the modern world with its effects are often subconscious and only brought to light when highly contrasting cultures or ideologies highlight it.</p>
            <p>For example, Europe is the almost universal spatial centre point for places such as the "East" broken up into near, middle, and far. This is a  prime example of a more subtle Eurocentrism, and it is not alone with even more profound examples found even in modern literature and science despite efforts to stop it. One of the greatest examples of this would be how most science is done in English regardless of location. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>This can be shown in Figure 1 which shows how the overwhelming majority of studies done in China are in English despite 92% of all Chinese citizens speaking Chinese, as said by Worlddata.<span class="footnote">1</span> Coupled with this, Western countries also hold all the advanced research technologies and technological equipment required to conduct complicated scientific research. They then conduct their research in developing nations that lack such equipment and claim all results for themselves. </p>
            <p>This can result in a technological monopoly by the Western countries where the West is perpetually kept more technologically advanced. Through this technological superiority comes a literal superiority where Western countries reap all the benefits of new research keeping the West dominant technologically. This leads to Western dominance in educational sectors and informational sectors as they are often very technologically dependent. Specifically, dominance in the educational sector is problematic because it leaves most curricula and textbooks based on Western resources. This thus leads to cultural homogenisation through the education sector as students are forced to see from a Western perspective.

            <p>A majority of tourists are American and the most visited continents are Europe and Asia (Fig 1). In particular, France, Spain, The US and China. When international tourists arrive in other countries, they cause a multitude of effects, either positive or negative. </p>
            <p>Masses of tourists can lead to cross-cultural interactions with locals or other tourists which leads to a mixing of both cultures. Masses of tourists can also have effects on communities and their property. This changes their cultural identity due to the behaviours, beliefs and values that they put into local communities.</p>
            <p>Along with this, other aspects of the culture like traditional clothing can be commodified to appeal to tourists more and get more money. This can be done by standardizing or simplifying culture to attract more tourists. This is where parts of culture are lost or threatened just to help visitors feel more comfortable and more enticed to buy something. A more specific case of this is Westernization. Due to most tourists coming from the US, items and arts like food or music are adopted to imitate or take heavy inspiration from Western practices and culture.</p>
            <p>One positive impact of tourists is the preservation of cultures as people communicate and interact with each other. Many visit countries to learn about their history and culture, for example, someone visiting an Asian country for their food. Aspects of that culture are preserved as more people try them. There are also some negatives like social conflict and religion. Some tourists have different belief systems compared to the countries they are visiting. This can cause outrage to some as they do not follow what the locals do. </p>
            <p>An example of this is France, the most visited place in Europe. On one hand, many job opportunities are available and created like souvenir shops, department stores and airports. Other businesses like bakeries also gain a boost of customers due to the popularity of French breads like baguettes and croissants. This helps promote cultural activities and items in France. On the other hand, there is a prioritisation of making profits instead of preserving actual genuine culture. The main focus of keeping actual cultural practices is inconsequential compared to making money from the popularity of French culture.</p>
