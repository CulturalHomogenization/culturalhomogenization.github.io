        <p>We are slowly letting our cultures fade away and we need to raise awareness and preserve our cultures. So what is cultural homogenisation, what are its causes, and how can we minimize its effects?</p>

          <p>In today's world cultures around the world are becoming more and more similar to on another and this is referred to as "<a href="#">cultural homogenisation</a>". <span>Cultural homogenisation refers to the increase in similarity of cultures resulting a lack of diversity.</span><span class="footnote">1</span>This phenomenon is driven by <span>globalization</span>, a factor that has significantly accelerated the exchange of ideas, values, and practices worldwide.</p>

          <p>Globalization, with increased international trade, connectivity and social media, has brought cultures together as people are now adopting aspects from many different cultures, including fashion, food, and business practices. This may sound positive but is actually one of the main driving factors of cultural homogenisation. </p>

          <p>An real world example of this would be the celebration of Christmas, which has become an almost worldwide celebration for many societies including a number of non-christian societies.<span class="footnote">2</span></p>

          <p>These changes can be far-reaching, occurring on a national scale, or even a global scale and often results in a loss of cultural diversity in cultures.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitleText">Digitalisation</h3>
            <p>Digitalization, has spread western and primarily American values around the globe. This is because most of the digital industry is American and so are most tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. Companies such as these now hold a lot of power over what we see in our media and can spread certain narratives, norms and values that often reflect western values. In turn, the different cultures of the world will slowly fade away.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitleText">Tourism</h3>
            <p>Tourism significantly contributes to cultural homogenization as it actively encourages the exchange of ideas and experiences. When tourists explore new destinations, they frequently interact with the locals and, at times, even with other tourists. Over time, these diverse interactions profoundly influence local traditions and ideas, gradually rendering cultures less and less distinct, ultimately contributing to cultural homogenization.</p>

            <p>Eurocentrism refers to the concept where European culture and history is considered as central and superior to others. It can lead to the marginalization or underrepresentation of non-European cultures. This perspective has historically influenced global attitudes, sometimes diminishing the recognition and value of diverse cultural contributions from around the world.</p>

          <p>Promoting cultural education and awareness is essential because it plays a crucial role in preventing cultural homogenization. This involves incorporating various cultures and traditions into existing educational systems. This approach can encompass a range of strategies, from encouraging students to learn and respect the traditions and history of other cultures to fostering greater cultural exchange among students.</p>
