          </div>
          <p>While food worldwide is usually unique and diverse, most people have shifted towards more westernised food practices like frying, fast foods, the use of other meats, the three meals a day ideology just to name a few. Many meals that people have today are simply modified versions of Western food.</p>
          <p>An example of this is Japan’s food history. Before the 1970s, most Japanese meals were traditional foods. However, in 1970 when the first KFC opened, the manager overheard foreigners reminiscing about having turkey for dinner. This resulted in the creation of the ‘Party Barrel’, which exploded into popularity later in 1874 after a marketing campaign.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Western food entered Japan much earlier though. Europeans entered Japan as early as in 1543 and have since been influencing the Japanese diet. The introduction of cooking books would later arrive in 1872 and this introduced many more European dietary ideas such as eating three meals a day, contrary to the traditional two meals a day the Japanese were used to. It also encouraged the use of many more types of meats such as pork and veal.</p>

          <p>Modern music is known for its simplicity and unoriginality. While old works had unique instruments and a wide range of genres. As time went on and technology improved, music started to deteriorate.</p>
          
          <p>This started in the 2000s as technology evolved into the music industry. Music became cheaper to produce and it was easier to get sales. Instead of selling physical media like cassette tapes or CDs, music could be streamed and sold online. With its popularisation, lots of artists could make easy money. Instead of relying on sales, all they needed to make money was a click from a screen on most streaming platforms, for example, Spotify. About x% of all money made from music. This along with the fact that these people try to replicate past hits to get the most success.</p>
